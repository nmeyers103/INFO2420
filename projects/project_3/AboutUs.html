    <p>Utah Backyard Birds began with a bird lover who took way too many pictures. Bart Jones started out as a backyard bird watcher. 
    He was an artist and photographer and birds were one of his favorite subjects. Many of the birds also captured in watercolors, 
    usually with some tree or flowers in the background. Bart would set out many different kinds of feed to attract as many bird 
    varieties as possible. Soon his backyard in Eureka became an aviary and the expense of keeping all his feathered visitors 
    fed was impacting his pocketbook.</p> 

    <p>After developing hundreds of bird photos and creating about a hundred watercolors, Bart decided to see how he could translate 
    his passion for these feathered friends into a money making venture. He decided to try to create a calendar and associated 
    postcard book and sell them to those who would enjoy the local wildlife.</p>

    <p>Utah Backyard Birds began as a company in 1997. Bart Jones compiled a wide variety of his best and most unique bird photos 
    into a calendar and postcard book series. His product line is available through this website and also can be found in Nature Lovers 
    stores countrywide. Each month of the calendar contains interesting information about the bird variety depicted for that month.</p> 

    <p>Not only does Bart just capture these birds, but he has also researched their behaviors, migration patterns and is a reservoir 
    of information about local Utah birds. He felt that he could share this knowledge with others as well as his wonderful still 
    life photographs and artwork.</p> 

    <div id="list">
        <p>Some of the many varieties of birds that appear in the calendars of Bart Jones include:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Rufous Hummingbirds</li> 
        <li>Great Blue Herons</li> 
        <li>American Bald Eagles</li> 
        <li>Baltimore Orioles</li> 
        <li>California Seagulls</li> 
        <li>Buntings</li>
        </ul>

    <p>While Utah Backyard Birds is still a young company, the artwork and photographic creations of Bart Jones have received much 
    adulation from art critics as well as the public. Many customers are repeat buyers year after year. Visitors to Utah can purchase 
    the postcard books at local bookstores, the Salt Lake Airport and also at local grocery stores. Bart Jones has big plans for the 
    future of the company. He would soon like to branch out into sharing his images of insects and arachnids (spiders). Some of his 
    macro-photography is truly inspiring.</p>
