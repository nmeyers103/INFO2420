    <h1>Web Site Critiques</h1>
    <h2>Website: <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home">Trader Joe's</a></h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>What was your first impression of this site?</li></h3>
            <p>
                My first impression of the Trader Joe's website was that it is very simple. 
                Everything is layed out very neatly, it is easy to navigate, and looks very clean.
            </p>

        <h3><li>How does this site organize the flow of information? 
        (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li></h3>
                <p>
                    They organize information with a navigation bar on the left side of the screen with 
                    links to all of the various pages on the site. The main body of the front page is divided 
                    into sections with headers, so as you scroll down, you know what each section is dedicated to.
                </p>

        <h3><li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The structure of the site makes sense. It is organized so the most important links on the 
                    navigation bar at the top, the front page sucks you in by advertising an article about what shoppers 
                    rated the best products, and as you scroll it shows whats new at the store. The structure makes it easy to find what you are looking for.
                </p>

        <h3><li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The sites graphics enhance the site greatly. Without them the website runs the risk of being a little too bland.
                </p>

        <h3><li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The website loaded almost instantly.
                </p>

        <h3><li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The text color and size were very readable. Most of the website is plain black text on a white background.
                    The landing page uses a background image of a corkboard that adds some variety and charm while stil making the information readable.
                </p>

        <h3><li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The site has a navigation bar on the left side with only 4 big icons which made it very easy to navigate. 
                    There is also a search bar in the top right corner if you are looking for something very specific, but it is
                    definitely not required to navigate the website.
                </p>

        <h3><li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    Yes it does. The pages are very simplistic color wise which make it very readable, but there are little illustrations in
                    the Trader Joe's style all around the page to give it some flavor and charm. The style is consistent between all of the pages, even
                    using a similar color scheme for all of the illustrations.
                </p>

        <h3><li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The website responds dynamically with the size of the page, with the navigation bar being reduced to a hamburger menu
                    so that mobile users are still able to navigate the site. All of the elements on the page still maintain order and neatness
                    in response to the size of the window.
                </p>

        <h3><li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li></h3>
                <p>
                    The site is excellent at keeping things simple and easy to navigate while also adding little bits of flavor and charm.
                    It makes for a very easy and engaging experience that leaves users satified. It also presents new information that 
                    you might not have known you wanted to see like recipies or blog posts in a way that isn't annoying and made me want to interact with them. 
                    In short, I liked being on the website.
                </p>
